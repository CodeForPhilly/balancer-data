This site is a first pass at example data for the Balancer application.

Additional Data can be added with a pull request to https://github.com/codeforphilly/balancer-data/

There are two things in the API:

- <i class="bi bi-capsule"></i> [List of Medications](/balancer-data/api/medications/index.json)
- <i class="bi bi-thermometer-half"></i> [List of Symptoms](/balancer-data/api/symptoms/index.json)
